	 * @brief Implements a convenient input interface for Arxx::Buffer.
	 * 
	 * The BufferWriter is implemented using a Arxx::Buffer::Marker to indicate the position at which the data is to be inserted into the buffer.
	 * 
	 * @note This also means that a BufferWriter is not referring to an index into the buffer but to a position in the data inside the buffer. Whenever changes occure to the data the input position will change in the same way that a Arxx::Buffer::Marker would. The default alignment of the Marker representing the insert position is LEFT, so that data changes at the insert position of the BufferWriter will not affect the marker. However if you insert data using the BufferWriter, the Alignment of the marker is set to RIGHT for the time of the insert thus moving the insert position behind the inserted data.
