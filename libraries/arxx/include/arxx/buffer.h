	/**
	 * @brief The core class of the Buffer.
	 *
	 * This class provides the concept of nested buffers. That means: you create one main buffer and it will behave like any other ordinary buffer you know. It is autoresizing as you add data, it provides prepend and append function, it has a position pointer which can be placed anywhere in the buffer to allow appending to that particular position.
	 *
	 * Additionally to that the nested buffers allow you to create compositions of buffers all acting on the same data block.
	 *
	 * Imagine a buffer of the size 16 bytes (name: Superior). Although this data may be handled as one entity, you, as the user of the Buffers library, know the semantics of this buffer: It may actually be three entities of data:
	 * - a 7-byte long block
	 * - a 5-byte long block
	 * - a 4-byte long block
	 * 
	 * Suppose now, that there is a library which (in any way) allows handling of a certain kind of data blocks. In our example it may be the first block of length 7. What you have to do is pass the buffer to the library, but this will violate the information hiding principle since this library now has access to the other datablock as well, maybe not even realizing that it isn't meant to meddle with them.
	 *
	 * Here comes the Buffers library which allows you to create sub buffers of our Superior buffer. By creating a buffer via Buffer(Superior, 0, 7)  you get a sub buffer with length 7 and I/O position at 0 which you may pass to the library. The content of this sub buffer is a reference to the superior buffer and thus contains exactly what is in the superior buffer from 0 to 7 at any given time. Now the library is only able to access the content it is meant to see.
	 *
	 * But this concept strives for more functionality. So it is also possible to perform any operations like appending, inserting and deleting. Using these operations will affect the content of the superior buffer but the effect will be limited to the region of the sub buffer. Any increases of the size of the sub buffer will also expand the superior buffer by the same amount.
	 * 
	 * The concept of buffers doesn't end at the first level of depth. They allow you to nest sub buffers in sub buffers, thus creating a buffer structure of arbitrary depth and complexity.
	 * 
	 * For that reason all operations that work on the buffer have to be implemented recursively. If you change a portion of data in a sub buffer, that change has to be propagated to the most superior buffer, which actually owns the associated memory. Only this sup buffer is allowed to change the content of the memory and in turn it has to ensure that the effect of any such change will be passed down to the leaf childs.

		/**
		 * @brief This function is called whenever the data of the sup buffer is changed in a way that also affects this buffer.
		 * @param stChangeMode Categorizes the type of change that affects @em this buffer.
		 * @param stPosition Indicates the location of the change inside @em this buffer.
		 * @param stLength Specifies the length of the change inside @em this buffer.
		 *
		 * There are three kinds of changes that may occure:
		 * - Updates
		 * - Deletes
		 * - Inserts
		 *
		 * Additionally there are two kinds of actions that need to be taken:
		 * - changes to @em this buffer (local changes)
		 * - changes to @em this buffer's sub buffers (structural changes).
		 *
		 * Updates are those changes that neither affect the length of @em this buffer nor its location inside the superior buffer. For that reason the parameters @a stPosition and @a stLength are not considered. The most probable reason why this change is issued is that the most superior buffer had to reallocate the memory for the buffer, because somewhere else so much data was inserted in the buffer that the capacity had to be enlarged.
		 * - The only local action taken here is to reset the m_Begin pointer to the correct location inside the sup buffer (m_pSupBuffer->m_Begin + m_stPosition).
		 * - The structural changes are equally simple: notify all sub buffers via vParentDataChanged(m_stDataUpdated, ?, ?). Position and length are not important here.
		 *
		 * Inserts are issued whenever the superior buffer inserts data. The @a stPosition indicates the location of the insert inside the sup buffer, so it is comparable with m_stPosition without further calculation. The @a stLength is the length of the portion of inserted data.
		 * @note Notice that this function is called even if the insert was not inside @em this buffer. If the Insertion was @em before this buffer (stPosition < m_stPosition) we need to reset m_stPosition. (This SHOULD be changed.)
		 * 
		 * - The local changes depend on the position of the insertion. If the data was inserted before this buffer we need to reset m_stPosition and m_Begin. If the data was inserted inside the buffer we need to reset m_stLength and possibly m_stIOPosition if (stPosition - m_stPosition) <= m_stIOPosition.
		 * - The structural changes are easy enough: just pass the change to any sub buffer by calling vParentDataChanged(m_stDataInserted, stPosition - m_stPosition, stLength). There is one exception to this: If @em this buffer made the initial change and the change request was passed up to the most superior buffer and now the changes are passed down again we don't apply changes here. Once all the changes are done and we return to the initial insertion function it is done then.
		 *
		 * Deletes are emitted whenever the superior buffer has deleted a portion of its data. The @a stPosition inticates where the beginning of the deletion block inside the parent is. Because of its scope, stPosition is directly comparable with m_stPosition. The @a stLength defines the length of the deletion.
		 * - The local changes is defined by the position and length of the deletion. There are six possibilities:
		 *   - The deletion is completely before @em this buffer: only m_stPosition needs to be decremented by stLength.
		 *   - The deletion begins before @em this buffer and overlaps the beginning: m_stPosition needs to be set to stPosition, m_stLength needs to be reduced by the overlapping.
		 *   - The deletion is completely inside @em this buffer: m_stLength needs to be reduced by stLength.
		 *   - The deletion begins inside @em this buffer and overlaps the end: m_stLength needs to be reduced by the size of the overlapping.
		 *   - The deletion is completely behind @em this buffer: nothing to be done.
		 *   - The deletion overlaps @em this buffer completely: m_Length is set to 0 and m_Position is set to Position.
		 * - The structural changes are very much the same as for Inserts. We just need to pass this change down to all sub buffers by calling vParentDataChanged(m_stDataDeleted, stPosition - m_stPosition, stLength).
