	 * @brief Instances of this class represent items either by unique ID or if known by pointer.

	 * All in all this is a cache for ARX::Item pointers.
     * Generally, you would identify ARX::Item instances by their unique IDs and retrieve the appropriate ARX::Item pointer via the associated library.
     * However, returning the item corresponding to a certain unique ID is costly and should only be done very seldom.
     * Therefore this class provides an abstraction for references to items.
	 * 
	 * When created via the copy constructor Reference objects share a reference counted ReferenceImplementation object that holds the actual reference.
     * This means that, once a unique ID is resolved into the appropriate Item pointer it is done so everywhere.
