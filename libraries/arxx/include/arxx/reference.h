	 * @brief Instances of this class represent items either by unique ID or if known by pointer.

	 * All in all this is a cache for Arxx::Item pointers. Generally, you would identify Arxx::Item instances by their unique IDs and retrieve the appropriate Arxx::Item pointer via the associated library. However, returning the Item corresponding to a certain unique ID is costy and should only be done very seldom. Therefore this class provides an abstraction for references to Items.
	 * 
	 * When created via the copy constructor Reference objects share a reference counted ReferenceImplementation object that holds the actual reference. This means that, once a unique ID is resolved into the appropriate Item pointer it is done so everywhere.
