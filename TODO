* When pressing C all cargo is ejected. But the C handler exhibits a few
  shortcomings of the current system:
	- We need a AddCargo() function. But cargo should be derieved from Object
	  and thus this speciallized function should not needed.
	- We create a new Cargo object. However the cargo object should be taken
	  from the ship.
	- The ship has no notion of Cargo objects only Cargo quatities. Place real
	  objects in the ship.

* Make windows movable with title handle.

* Clip windows.

* Make fuel a normal good.

* Rename GetCargo to GetCommodities.

* Rename GetRootElement to GetDocumentElement.

* Save and load MapKnowledge.

* Load the commodities as well.

* Save and load player environment (Camera, Zoom, TimeWarp, Targets ...)

* Make loading the savegames much more robust.

* Make the game more robust against missing resource files.

* PlayerCharacter and PlayerShip have no defined lifetimecycle and cause memory leaks now. Specify and implement.
