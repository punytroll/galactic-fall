1. The program is offline. There is no network layer and no server entity that may override behavior or veto any changes requested by the program.
2. The program runs in a single thread. At each point in the program execution it is absolutely clear who has access to what variables.

The update pipline:
- message dispatching
- artificial intelligence
- game logic
- physical simulation
	- more game logic for collisions
- rendering
