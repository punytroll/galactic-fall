The Class Concept
=====================

This document describes the idea behind the class concept in this program.

The Problem
===========

At a certain point in the development of this project a considerable amount of source code had been written to provide a class system to the game objects. The classes were intended to provide a set of characteristics, common to a subset of game objects. The game objects could reference a certain class which was holding the information that was common to all game objects of this particular class.

Take for example the class Ship. Every instance of this class, that is every ship in the program, held a reference (a pointer, really) to a ShipClass object which described some characteristics that were common among all ships that referenced this ShipClass object.

While this approach uses memory quiet efficiently and provides a good way to hold common data in a central place it also has some disadvantages.

First of all it lacks flexibility at runtime. It is absolutly impossible to "enhance" a certain property of one instance and leave all other instances unchanged. This of course can also be considered a feature, because that is, what it was designed for. However, the need for this kind of flexibility is getting more and more obvious.

Secondly this approach is tedious to implement. Every "class of object" (as in ships, weapons, generators, ...) requires a whole set of new C++ classes. Given you wanted to add a class "Shield", this would also add "ShieldClass", "ShieldClassManager" and some reading functions to the ARX reading class.


The Solution
============

The Class concept was conceived to put an end to this C++ class inflation and, at the same time, provide more flexibility inside the game.


The Roadmap
===========

Implementing the Class system and integrating it into the program will be done in many minor steps.

1. Generalize the *ClassManager classes with a template class called ClassManager< ClassType >.
