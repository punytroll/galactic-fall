# galactic-fall

A very simple 2D space shooter designed in the spirit of and as an hommage to "Escape Velocity".

Overall "Galactic Fall" is discontinued. There is no plan to develop this project into a real game, suited for distributing to "players". I simply lack the amount of resources needed to finalize such a project.

BUT: I'm continually working on stuff in the game system. Under the hood, all application modules are somewhat in need of cleanups, extensions and fixes. There are some assertions, segmentation faults and exceptions that could be handled or avoided.
Also, from time to time, I'm adding new functionality. Mainly to see a certain feature in a working application or to test an interesting implementation idea.
